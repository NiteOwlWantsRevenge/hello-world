Well, let me get this straight first... I AM AWESOME!!! I love to code...well... stuff!!! I also like to read anime. Some of my favorite anime are Dragon Ball, Naruto, and One Piece. My favorite book is Harry Potter ( the whole series, of course!! ). I play the piano, violin, and flute. My favorite foods are a tie between sushi & ramen. Then, well, that's about it.
